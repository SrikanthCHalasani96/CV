    <strong>Masters Final Project: Data Analysis 2022</strong>
<p><em>Title: Bitcoin On Chain data analysis (bitcoin price prediction) using LSTM, BI- DIRECTIONAL LSTM,
GRU Techniques</em></p>
  <ul>
  <ol>

<li> Utilised Python to implement different techniques of Deep Learning Models to obtain the loss function
real time price and its prediction</li>
<li>Data set used here is fetched from API and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) implemented .
<p>Technique-1(Analysis part) : Big Query is used to fetch the data set and analysed in Kaggle notebook to
understand the data for its attributes and contents,<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/srikanthchalasani/bitcoinanalysispart1">kaggle</a>
<li>Technique-2(Prediction part) : LSTM( Long Short Term Memory) , Bi-Directional LSTM, Gated
Recurrent unit (GRU) models are used from Recurrent Neural Network(R-NN)</li>
<li>Technique-3: After implementation these models yielded the loss function and price prediction is done
based on real time Price.</li>

<strong>Internship: Teesside University </strong>                                                                                                                2021
<p><em>Title:  Diagnosis of Lumbar Spine Disc Herniation using machine learning and deep learning algorithms</em></p>
<ul>
  <ol>
  <P><li>Identified feasible algorithms through qualitative research approach and pre-processed the data of 575 patients spine x-rays </li> </P>
  	<li>The data set (x-ray images) are segregated before implementation of models for training and accuracy   </li>
  <li>The aim was to identify the herniated disc in the x-rays of each patient so implementation of machine learning and deep learning algorithms like Mobile net v2, Xception algorithm, VGG16, Sequential CNN and accuracy was obtained.</li>
  <li>Implemented the mobile net v2 and obtained accuracy of 66% as part of my role in the project. </li>
